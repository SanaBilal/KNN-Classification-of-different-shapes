# KNN-Classification-of-different-shapes

Goal:
-- identifying different shapes in the files given using classification algorithm of KNN

Steps:
--training a file having different objects in this case circles,triangles,squares, rectangles etc
-- gives a test file having objects
-- identify the objects using pre-trained properties and KNN classification
